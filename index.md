## About Me

I am a self-motivated and driven individual who loves learning, building solutions, and helping others succeed. Throughout my career, I’ve built Documentation systems, Device Management systems, and Learning Management systems, with a focus on security, simplicity, and scalability. I’ve excelled at both Technical Writing and Systems Administration due to my ability to learn quickly, document effectively, and build solutions that solves current needs with the foundation to solve future problems. My curiosity for detail-oriented learning has led to a love for coding, which helps me understand how things work and provides the opportunity to create specific solutions to unique challenges. I’m looking for new opportunities in remote-embracing companies with a mission to positively impact the world.
